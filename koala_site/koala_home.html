  <h2>Welcome to the <strong>Koala Bear National Information Center!</strong></h2>
  <h3>In this site you can learn about Koala bears, adopt a Koala, give to our foundation, sign up for our newsletter, or schedule a visit.</h3>
  <h3>Please take some time to explore the information provided in this site!</h3>
  
  <p>The Koala Bear National Information Center <em>(KBNIC)</em>is the principal non-profit, non-government organization dedicated to the conservation and effective management of the wild koala and its habitat.
  <p>The <em>KBNIC</em> was formed in 2006. Since our founding  the KBNIC has grown from a small group of people interested in researching koala disease, to a well-known, global organization with a strong track record in strategic koala research, conservation and community education with a huge focus on mapping -- our absolute strength.
  <p>Koalas are disappearing. Loss of koala habitat and koala food trees (eucalyptus leaves) is the leading koala threat. Our cuddly koalas are loved around the world. Often called a koala bear, they are actually marsupials not koala bears. Please help koalas by supporting the Australian Koala Foundation.
